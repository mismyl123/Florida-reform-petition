		<h1>Release or Home Confinement for Florida Prisoners from
			COVID-19 Coronavirus</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Urgent and Just Responses to COVID-19 in the Florida Justice System</h2>
		<p>People incarcerated in prisons lack access to some of the most basic disease prevention measures. Certain
			cleaning
			supplies and sanitizers are classified as contraband, and running water, soap, and the freedom to social
			distance are often
			simply out of reach. <a
				href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-prisons-and-jails-can-respond-to-the-coronavirus">Health
				experts</a> warn that a serious and urgent response must be implemented.
		</p>
		<p>Many correctional facilities are either unaware of the Centers for Disease Control’s guidelines for disease
			prevention, or
			they are hindered from adhering to these guidelines due to a lack of resources for incarcerated individuals
			and the staff and
			officers who work in correctional facilities. We have <a
				href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30663-8/fulltext">valid fear
				that the inevitable spread</a> of the virus, which makes those
			who are incarcerated particularly vulnerable to the disease, and leaves these facilities as a whole
			susceptible to a
			devastating outbreak.
		</p>
		<p>While all people working or <a
				href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/worker-safety-support/">living in confinement
				settings are at risk</a> , the virus will be especially dangerous for the rapidly
			growing aging population, those with disabilities, and those with chronic health issues, such as individuals
			with
			autoimmune diseases and immunocompromised individuals.
		</p>

		<p>Moreover, the impact of an inadequate response reaches far beyond incarcerated people themselves. When this
			<a
				href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html">highly
				transmissible</a> virus passes through facilities, confined individuals are likely to contract the virus
			from staff who enter and
			exit facilities daily—and staff who have not yet been infected will be at greater risk of becoming ill.
		</p>

		<p>This will be exacerbated by the significant <a
				href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/records/4131-prison-understaffing">understaffing</a> issues
			already plaguing prisons. As concerns about contracting the
			virus rise for staff members, and as childcare becomes less accessible for staff members who are primary
			caretakers,
			staffing facilities will become more difficult. This will create significant safety risks for both
			incarcerated people and staff.
			Today, state/government officials and the DOJ still have the opportunity to act decisively in the interest
			of public safety
			before the pandemic escalates to the level of severity that it has already <a
				href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/inmates-revolt-italian-prisons-restrict-visitors-due-coronavirus/story?id=69539760">escalated
				in other countries</a>
		</p>

		<p>In addition to strategies to slow the spread of this virus and “flatten the curve,” we recommend mitigation
			strategies to
			prevent further dangerous situations, such as the riots and death that have occurred in facilities in China
			and Italy, and
			instead align with best practices and protect those most vulnerable with a humane, safety-focused, public
			health response -
			Much like the release of prisoners we have seen in <a
				href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/middleeast/iran-coronavirus-response-intl/index.html">Iran.</a>
		</p>

		<p>For this reason, a coalition of experts—many of those with lived experience—have come together to develop a
			list of the
			most urgent and necessary recommendations to ensure the well-being and safety of our communities in prison
			facilities.
			For the sake of people in prison, of prison staff, and of our entire community, we must take significant
			action now!
			The administration of correctional facilities, prosecutors, and executives must all act to limit and slow
			the spread of this
			infection in jails and prisons.</p>

		<h2>Florida’s Criminal Justice System Is <a href="https://toughenoughoncrime.com/42-2/">Expensive</a>, Unsafe
		and a <a href="https://www.floridaphoenix.com/2020/03/10/harmful-and-inhumane-prison-conditions-demand-action-by-lawmakers-but-is-time-running-out/">Humanitarian
		Crisis</a> </h2>

		<h3>Florida is one of only 16 states that doesn’t offer parole. Bills that call to reduce gain-time from 85% to
			65% are pushed away, despite <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/opinion/20200226/editorial-time-for-florida-lawmakers-to-get-smart-on-criminal-justice-reform">public
			approval</a> . States offer a scoresheet as an alternative to parole, yet
			judges do not abide by the scoresheets- inmates(many are non-violent drug offenders) are forced to accept
			much longer plea deals for fear of “enhanced penalties” pushed by prosecutors. All inmates should be
			reviewed & either given the term the scoresheet dictated, or immediately bring back parole and allow a
			Parole Board to determine the release of the inmate. The current method of Florida scoresheets being
			disregarded and no option for parole is unconstitutional. The current Head of Florida DOC states
			<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/12/01/florida-prisons-cant-go-on-like-this-new-chief-says/">"Florida
			Prisons can’t go on like this"</a> . This petition is urging the State of Florida to take action
			immediately!</h3>

		<h3>We must reduce the prison population.</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li> Particularly vulnerable people (older people, those with chronic illnesses, pregnant people, those
					with asthma,
					cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, etc) should be allowed to go home to the care of
					their families.</li>
				<li> We should release people in prisons and jails who are within 2 years of completing their sentences.
				</li>
				<li>People that are first-time offenders and/or offenders of low-level, non-violent offenses should be
					immediately
					released from prisons with transitional plans, such as home confinement or transitional housing
					close to their
					homes. </li>
				<li> People with unaffordable money bails should be released. If a judge has given someone a money bond,
					it means
					that they’ve determined the person is cleared for release pretrial. Their ongoing incarceration due
					solely to
					access to money is deeply unfair and unethical, especially during this pandemic.</li>
				<li>No new people should be incarcerated on money bonds. Admission of as many people as possible should
					be
					avoided. </li>
				<li> The courts should provide emergency bond reviews for all incarcerated people who request them with
					an
					increased mandate to use all options other than incarceration. </li>
				<li> Release and stop jailing anyone charged with an offense that does not involve a serious physical
					safety risk to a
					reasonably identifiable person. This includes technical violations of parole or probation regardless
					of the
					underlying offense, including failures to appear. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Basic health protections should be implemented within jails and prisons. </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We must reduce the prison, and the jail population to ensure that capacity is such that cells are not
				shared, there
				are sufficient medical beds, and enough prison staff to ensure safety for staff, those incarcerated, and
				visitors. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>We must provide soap, CDC-recommended hand sanitizer, medical care, comprehensive sanitation and cleaning of
			facilities, and other safety measures as recommended by the CDC for those who remain incarcerated free of
			charge.
		</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Parole boards should be IMPLEMENTED NOW in Florida to expedite the release of those who have
					served 65% of their sentence or the entirety of their scoresheet.</li>
				<li>Incarcerated people who test positive should be released to an external healthcare facility to
					receive care. </li>
				<li> Solitary confinement is NOT a substitute for providing people in prison who are exposed to COVID-19
					with
					proper medical care. </li>
				<li>We should provide separate bathrooms for use by people who are symptomatic. </li>
				<li>Ensure families and lawyers have access to regular communications channels with incarcerated loved
					ones or
					clients, including but not limited to phone calls, email, video conferencing, postage mail. Limits
					on calls, emails,
					and video conferencing should be greatly increased, the fees should be waived.</li>
				<li> Eligible inmates should be released on electronic monitoring,
					<a
						href="https://www.corrections1.com/re-entry-and-recidivism/articles/best-practices-for-electronic-monitoring-post-incarceration-jEPLp0E1ArBdbhr0/">
						because evidence suggests electronic monitoring plus home detention could be an effective
						deterrent to crime and have enormous social benefits </a> </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The FL DOC has handled the COVID crisis by cancelling visitation completely for the past SEVEN months,
			despite
			<a href="https://www.pacific-gateway.org/reentry,%20employment%20and%20recidivism.pdf">empirical research
				suggests that encouraging families to remain intact may help lower recidivism</a> . Inmates were
			quarantined and not given proper medical treatment.
		</p>

		<p>Cancelling visitation hasn’t worked to keep COVID out of the prison system. At the time of this writing, there are currently 16,444 inmates that
			tested positive
			and 141 confirmed COVID deaths. The medical care for these inmates has been abysmal. There is no timeline
			for the
			end of the COVID pandemic, it is past time to reform Florida’s prisons. This is not about politics, this is
			about having a
			moral conscience, we cannot leave these first time offenders, non violent offenders there to just die from
			this deadly
			virus. Florida should have re-evaluated their actions regarding inmate safety after the <a
				href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2019/05/02/bay-county-inmates-planning-lawsuit-alleging-neglect-during-hurricane-michael/3655872002/">atrocious
				handling of Hurricane Michael.</a>
		</p>
		<p>Again, Florida hired a new DOC Secretary in 2019, who is <a
				href="https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20190104/floridas-new-prison-chief-seen-as-friendly-to-reform">calling
				for MUCH NEED reform in Florida’s prisons, </a> yet
			the legislators aren’t listening. The system is crumbling, this will end poorly, let’s get ahead of his NOW.

		</p>
		<p>
			We ask that the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, DOC Secretary Mark Inch, the DOC as a whole, the DOJ, the
			DOJ's
			Civil Right’s Division, and Government Officials issue directives to state & federal agencies and recipients
			of state &
			federal funds who have the authority to act on these directives to safely reduce correctional populations
			and protect
			incarcerated individuals and staff within correctional institutions.
